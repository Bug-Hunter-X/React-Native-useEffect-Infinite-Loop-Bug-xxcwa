The corrected code includes a dependency array in the `useEffect` hook. This array specifies that the effect should only run when the `count` variable changes.  This prevents the infinite loop by ensuring that the effect only runs when necessary.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect called with count:', count);
    // Perform some side effect here, like an API call
  }, [count]); // Dependency array added here

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
