This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: an infinite loop caused by improper use of the `useEffect` hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue arises from the missing dependency array in the `useEffect` hook, leading to continuous re-renders.  The solution involves adding a dependency array to ensure the effect runs only when the specified values change.
